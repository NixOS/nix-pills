# Preface

This is a ported version of the **Nix Pills**, a series of blog posts written by **Luca Bruno** (aka Lethalman) and originally published in 2014 and 2015. It provides a tutorial introduction into the Nix package manager and Nixpkgs package collection, in the form of short chapters called 'pills'.

Since the Nix Pills are considered a classic introduction to Nix, an effort to port them to the current format was led by Graham Christensen (aka grahamc / gchristensen) and other contributors in 2017.

For an up-to-date version, please visit <https://nixos.org/guides/nix-pills/>. An [EPUB version](https://nixos.org/guides/nix-pills/nix-pills.epub) is also available.
